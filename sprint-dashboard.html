      <h2 class="h2">Why This Sprint Matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Most dashboards inside Aspire don't fail because of the software. They fail because they're disconnected from real responsibility. When a dashboard reflects what you actually manage—and when the data behind it is trusted—it becomes more than a report. It becomes a control panel for decisions.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This sprint exists to turn dashboards from passive screens into active tools. By the end, you'll have a dashboard tied directly to your role, your goals, and a process for improving a real metric during this sprint—not someday, but now.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Dashboards are often the first place teams realize whether their systems are actually supporting the year ahead.

        Dashboards only drive action when data, responsibility, and ownership are connected together. This sprint combines all three so you create something that lasts—not just something that looks good.

      <div class="grid-3 grid-3--cards">
        <article class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">It Starts With What You Actually Manage</h3>
          <p>You choose the widgets based on real responsibilities, so your dashboard reflects your work—not a template or someone else's priorities.</p>

        <article class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">It Confronts Data Accuracy</h3>

          The investment for the Dashboard Sprint includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-check">
          <li>Four weeks of instruction and accountability</li>
          <li>Customized feedback and a 1:1 session</li>
          <li>Worksheets, SOP templates, and a roadmap framework</li>
          <li>Cohort support and guided working sessions</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
          ROI is measured in more than dollars. It's how quickly you can spot issues, influence outcomes, improve accuracy, and make better decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Even modest improvements in hours, invoicing, routing, or labor can offset the cost of the sprint.

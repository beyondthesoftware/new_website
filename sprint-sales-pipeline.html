      <h2 class="h2">Why This Sprint Matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        If it's not in Aspire, it might as well not exist. When your book of business lives partly in a spreadsheet, partly in emails, and partly in someone's head, you can't forecast accurately, track conversion rates, or build revenue confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        In this sprint, you'll bring your pipeline into Aspire where it becomes visible, measurable, and useful. You'll work on the fundamentals of pipeline hygiene to build lists and refine workflows that make it easy to track activity, understand downstream impact, and see how your effort translates into real opportunity.

      <h2 class="h2">Who This Sprint Is For</h2>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        This sprint is designed for:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Sales Managers, Sales Reps, Business Development or Account Managers with sales responsibilities who are ready to organize their pipeline</li>
        <li>Those with a sales focus on either landscape maintenance or enhancements</li>
        <li>Teams currently managing at least some part of the sales process outside Aspire (spreadsheets, emails, a separate CRM)</li>
        <li>Beginner to intermediate Aspire users who want more structure</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        Expect about two hours per week for implementation. If you already have a sales goal, you'll feel immediate value as your data gets clearer and easier to act on.

      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        Over four weeks, you'll build foundational habits and systems that make your pipeline cleaner, clearer, and easier to manage:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Useful lists and dashboards for real-time pipeline visibility</li>
        <li>A scalable sales process that starts simple and grows with you</li>
        <li>Tools for funnel management and follow-up discipline</li>
        <li>Clarity on what to track so downstream teams aren't left guessing</li>
        <li>A documented weekly pipeline routine you can stick to</li>
        <li>Leadership-ready reports that show pipeline status</li>
        <li>A 1:1 mini consulting call to work through a roadblock or customization</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        By the end, you'll know exactly where every opportunity stands, what needs attention, and how close you are to your goals.

        <div class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Week 1 — Build</h3>
          <p>
            Create contact, property, and proposal lists; structure follow-up reminders; and build views that make daily activity obvious and manageable. You'll establish the backbone of your pipeline inside Aspire.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Week 2 — Discover</h3>
          <p>
            Map how your data flows downstream and get feedback from those who inherit your deals. Learn where your input helps (or hinders) handoffs, production planning, and client onboarding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Week 3 — Action</h3>
          <p>
            Clean out old proposals, add missing information, and tighten your process to reinforce pipeline hygiene. Your 1:1 mini call helps you overcome sticking points, tailor the process to your role, or deepen your tracking strategy.
          </p>

        <div class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Week 4 — Sustain</h3>
          <p>
            Document your SOP, set calendar reminders, and share your process so the whole team benefits. Then build a reporting view you can use to communicate pipeline activity to leadership with confidence.

        This sprint isn't passive learning—it's guided implementation. You'll get:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Weekly working sessions to build your tools and habits</li>
        <li>A private community for questions and quick wins</li>
        <li>Feedback tied directly to your pipeline</li>
        <li>One included 1:1 call to solve a specific roadblock</li>
        <li>A push to build consistency because progress is stronger than perfection</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">

        Momentum Lab is led by seasoned Aspire operators who have built and run sales processes inside the system—not just taught theory. We've worked with organizations where sales activity lived in spreadsheets, inboxes, and memory… and we've seen exactly how much stronger the operation becomes when pipeline data is consistent, centralized, and visible.
      </p>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        We understand how Aspire fits into real-world selling, and how to make it easier, not harder.

      <h2 class="h2">Why This Sprint Matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        If it's not in Aspire, it might as well not exist. When your book of business lives partly in a spreadsheet, partly in emails, and partly in someone's head, you can't forecast accurately, track conversion rates, or build revenue confidence.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        In this sprint, you'll bring your sales pipeline fully into Aspire where it becomes visible, measurable, and useful. You'll work on the fundamentals of pipeline hygiene, building lists and refining workflows that make it easier to track activity, understand downstream impact, and see how your effort turns into real opportunity.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Who This Sprint Is For</h2>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        This sprint is designed for those with sales responsibility who are ready to bring structure to their pipeline, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Business Development leaders, Sales Managers, or Account Managers who have significant sales responsibilities</li>
        <li>Teams focused on landscape maintenance or enhancement sales</li>
        <li>Anyone currently managing part of the sales process outside Aspire (spreadsheets, emails, a separate CRM)</li>
        <li>Beginner to intermediate Aspire users who want more structure</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        Expect about two hours per week to implement what you're learning. If you already have a sales goal, you'll feel value quickly as your pipeline becomes clearer and easier to act on.

      <h2 class="h2">What You'll Get</h2>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        Over four weeks, you'll build practical habits and systems that make your pipeline cleaner, clearer, and easier to manage, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Useful lists and dashboards for real-time pipeline visibility</li>
        <li>A scalable sales process that starts simple and grows with you</li>
        <li>Tools to support funnel management and consistent follow-up</li>
        <li>Clear guidance on what to track so downstream teams aren't left guessing</li>
        <li>A documented weekly pipeline routine you can stick to</li>
        <li>Leadership-ready reports that show pipeline status</li>
        <li>One dedicated 1:1 support call to work through a roadblock or customization</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        By the end, you'll know exactly where every opportunity stands, what needs attention, and how close you are to your goals.

        This sprint turns everyday sales activity into a scalable pipeline system. The work builds week over week, focusing on structure, insight, action, and sustainability so your pipeline becomes something you can actually rely on.

          <p>
            Create contact, property, and proposal lists; structure follow-up reminders; and build views that make daily activity obvious and manageable. You'll establish the backbone of your pipeline inside Aspire.

          <h3 class="h3">Week 2: Discover</h3>

            Map how your data flows downstream and get feedback from the teams who inherit your deals. Learn where your input helps (or hinders) handoffs, production planning, and client onboarding.

        <div class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Week 3: Action</h3>
          <p>
            Clean out old proposals, add missing information, and tighten your process to reinforce pipeline hygiene. Your 1:1 support call helps you work through sticking points, tailor the process to your role, or deepen your tracking strategy.

        <div class="card card--muted">

      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Weekly working sessions to build your tools and habits</li>
        <li>A private community for questions and quick wins</li>
        <li>Feedback tied directly to your pipeline</li>
        <li>One included 1:1 support call to work through a specific roadblock</li>
        <li>Encouragement to build consistency, because progress is stronger than perfection</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">

        Momentum Lab is led by experienced Aspire operators who have built and run sales processes inside the system, not just taught theory. We've worked with organizations where sales activity lived in spreadsheets, inboxes, and memory and we've seen how much stronger operations become when pipeline data is consistent, centralized, and visible.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-center" style="max-width: 48rem; margin: 0 auto 2.5rem;">
        We understand how Aspire fits into real-world selling, and how to make it easier, not harder.

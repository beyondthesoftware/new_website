  <!-- Why this sprint matters -->

      <h2 class="h2">Why This Sprint Matters</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        For many companies, End of Month is treated like a financial ritual. The numbers go in, reports come out, and Production's role is limited to answering questions or correcting mistakes. But here's the truth: if Production isn't involved, you're not closing the month accurately or efficiently.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This sprint reframes EOM as a proactive, weekly rhythm owned jointly by Operations and Finance. You'll learn simple, repeatable habits that make EOM smoother, faster, and far more accurate, without the scramble, clean-up, or finger-pointing. When Production understands what the business needs and can contribute consistently, everyone wins.

      <p class="lead" style="max-width: 48rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        This sprint is designed for Production/Operations leaders who are responsible for Production outcomes and want clarity about what the Aspire data means. End of month works best when Production is involved early, not pulled in after something breaks. This sprint is designed to help Operations leaders take proactive ownership of the data.

        This sprint is designed to fit into a busy operations role. You're already juggling crews, schedules, and real-world problems, and this sprint respects that reality. This work matters, but it shouldn't take over your week. Each phase is designed to be tackled in about two hours, with progress building week over week so you're never trying to fix everything at once.

      <h2 class="h2">Why It Works</h2>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        Most EOM holdups aren't caused by complex software. They're caused by habits and handoffs.
      </p>
      <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        This sprint works because it focuses on three shifts:
      </p>

      <div class="grid-3 grid-3--cards">
        <article class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Panel 1: Weekly, Not Monthly</h3>
          <p>
            You'll turn month-end into a simple weekly routine to verify and approve data while it's still fresh and before running payroll locks in the data.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Panel 2: Proactive Ownership</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of reacting to issues at the end of the month, you intentionally review and correct data each week so problems don't pile up.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="card card--muted">
          <h3 class="h3">Panel 3: Production-Friendly Language</h3>
          <p>
            We translate financial expectations into practical actions. No accounting jargon. You don't need to be a numbers person to play a meaningful role in EOM. You just need clear direction on what to do and when to do it.
          </p>
        </article>
      </div>

      <p class="lead" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        When the field and office operate from the same playbook, everything gets easier.

        The benefits will be evident quickly:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-check" style="max-width: 48rem;">
        <li>Less time spent chasing corrections</li>
        <li>Cleaner data and fewer reopenings</li>

        <li>Stronger support for Finance</li>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="lead">Typical EOM training shows you where to click or what reports to run. This sprint focuses on the production behaviors and data hygiene that make EOM accurate in the first place.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">

            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="lead">Because month-end performance reflects production execution. When Production keeps work tickets current, billing accuracy becomes proactive rather than reactive. That reduces corrections, questions, and back-and-forth during EOM.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">

            <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="lead">Because the old approach doesn't scale as the business grows. Correcting details after the fact creates delays and revenue risk. When Production documents accurately in real time, EOM becomes a predictable, repeatable process instead of a scramble.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="lead">Yes. The frameworks you'll learn reduce confusion between Production and Admin or Production and Finance by clarifying who owns what, when updates must be made, and how issues are escalated. You'll walk away with defined handoffs rather than vague expectations.</p>
